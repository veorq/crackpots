# Crackpots and charlatans list

List of crackpot 'scientists' and 'thinkers' abusing their academic
credentials (if any) or past legitimate works (if any) to spread
misinformation and/or pseudoscience and/or nonsense and capitalize on
their audience's ignorance and gullibility. 
We particularly call out scholars from respectable institutions
that turned from respectable researchers to profit-driven
sensationalism and spread falshoods or speculation as facts on general
media, popular books, podcasts, or TED talks.

Dislaimers:
* The list doesnt include the obvious frauds like flatearthers, medbed
  promoters, or astrologers.
* It also doesnt include the many crackpots in the fields of global
  warming and vaccination, for lack of space and time
* Crackpotery's type and degree varies; not all crackpots are equally
  sinful and deceptive
* You need enough visibility and crackpotism activity to deserve to
  appear in the list
* Crackpotology, the art of identifying crackpots, goes from basic red
  flags counting to expert review of their claims. Everyone listed here
  was clearly identified as a crackpot. One may object "I read
  their book and I loved it" or "they also did research X which is
  completely legit"; these are mutually exclusive with them being a
  crackpot.
