# Crackpots and charlatans 

We publish a list of crackpot 'scientists' and 'thinkers' abusing their
academic credentials (if any) or past legitimate works (if any) to
spread misinformation pseudoscience, or nonsense for personal gain. 
We especially highlight individuals from reputable institutions who have
transitioned from credible researchers to profit-driven sensationalists,
spreading falsehoods or speculative ideas as facts through mainstream
media, popular books, podcasts, or TED Talks.  These figures capitalize
on their audience's ignorance and gullibility, undermining genuine
scientific discourse. They include characters from outright scammers to
researchers past their prime having 'forgotten' how science works.

## The list

Alphabetically:

* [Lee Cronin](https://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/) (assembly theory, chemcomputer)
* [Robert E. Grant](https://robertedwardgrant.com/) (the Time AI guy)
* [Michio Kaku](https://mkaku.org/) (quantum computing)
* [Dean Kamen](https://www.firstinspires.org/about/leadership/dean-kamen) ("inventor")
* [Ray Kurzweil](https://www.thekurzweillibrary.com/) (yes, the singularity guy)
* [Avi Loeb](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/) (aliens existence)
* [Max Tegmark](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/home.html) (multiverse)
* [Sara Walker](https://search.asu.edu/profile/1731899) (assembly theory)


## Dislaimers

* The list doesnt include the obvious frauds like flatearthers, medbed
  promoters, or astrologers.
* It also doesnt include the many crackpots in the fields of global
  warming and vaccination, for lack of space and time.
* Crackpotery's type and degree varies; not all crackpots are equally
  sinful and deceptive.
* You need enough visibility and crackpotism activity to deserve to
  appear in the list.
* Crackpotology, the art of identifying crackpots, goes from basic red
  flags counting to expert review of their claims. Everyone listed here
  was clearly identified as a crackpot. One may object "I read
  their book and I loved it" or "they also did research X which is
  completely legit"; these are mutually exclusive with them being a
  crackpot.
* Obviously, the list isnt exhaustive.
